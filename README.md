# Hi, I’m Kazi.

Netlify builds this code to make my website.

### I used:
- Baryton, a font by [Coppers and Brasses](https://www.coppersandbrasses.com/typefaces/baryton/)
- PolySans, a font by [Gradient](https://wearegradient.net/polysans/)
	- The links are made weird looking by [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org)
- Color gradient inspired by [Wado Sanzo | A Dictionary of Color Combinations](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io/about)
- [GSAP ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/) for the gradient scroll animation
- Some stuff from this [CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset) by Andy Bell
- Andrey Sitnik’s [favicon strategy](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs)
- [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) by Martin Tournoij to track you if/when you visit
- Service worker tooling called [Google Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox)
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev) for my build tooling
